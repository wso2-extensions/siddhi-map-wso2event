In default mapping, the format used is the pre-defined WSO2Event format that adheres to the schema of the defined stream. In order to use custom mapping, additional parameters need to be configured (i.e., in addition to the format type). This is useful when the events are generated by a third party and as a result, you do not have control over how they are formatted.<br></p></div>
